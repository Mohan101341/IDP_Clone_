    Canada is a premier destination for nearly half a million international students, renowned for offering high-quality, affordable education with degrees that are recognised worldwide. Canadian universities not only provide a great return on investment but also rank highly on global indices for quality of life, making it an attractive location for students from around the globe, including a large number from India.

     Furthermore, Canada enhances the value of its educational offerings with up to three years of post-study work rights and favourable immigration policies that facilitate pathways to permanent residency for graduates. This combination of educational excellence, economic opportunity, and high standards of living positions Canada as a top choice for pursuing higher education.

      <h1>Latest Update for Canada</h1>
      <p>
       <strong>Study Permit Cap:</strong> In 2025, IRCC plans to issue 437,000 visas, a 10% reduction compared to the 2024 targets. Despite a 35% cap introduced in January 2024, IDP observed no significant impact on student seat allocations. It is advised to expedite the student application process at all stages to mitigate any potential risks due to the cap. </p>
      <p> <strong>Changes to Master’s and PhD Programs: </strong>A Pre-Arrival Letter (PAL) is now required for Master’s and higher-level programs. 12% of permits are specifically reserved for these students. The process for obtaining a PAL has been streamlined by universities and poses no risk for IDP. PAL has become a mandatory document for study permit applications for Master’s programs.</p>
    
      <p>  <strong>Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP):</strong> Graduates from programs at public colleges that are linked to occupations facing long-term labor shortages will remain eligible for a PGWP of up to 3 years. IDP continues to service all study levels with the potential to secure a 3-year PGWP, aligned with labor market needs as defined by provincial and federal governments.</p>
     <p> <strong>ELT Requirement for PGWP:</strong> From November 1, 2024, all PGWP applicants must demonstrate a minimum language proficiency. University graduates need to meet Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) Level 7, and college graduates need CLB Level 5. An IELTS score of 6 is equivalent to CLB 7, and a score of 4-4.5 is equivalent to CLB 5.</p>
     <p> <strong>Spouse Work Permit: </strong>Spouses of Master’s students enrolled in a 16-month program or longer in designated essential programs will be eligible for a work permit. This makes it essential for students to enroll in qualifying Master’s programs to enable their spouses to work in Canada.
